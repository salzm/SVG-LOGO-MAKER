# SVG Logo Generator

SVG Logo Generator

## Description

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file]. he application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

## Usage

For this task, we had to start from scratch, so we needed a lib to house the shapes js and the test case of that to see a pass / fail senario based on what we have written. From there, in the index.js houses where we connect the two files shapes.js and shapes.test.js and makes sure they run! From there, we added the user input in the JS index file for the user to input the questions and then generate the logo svg file. The code works, but when I generate the file, the svg logo works."
